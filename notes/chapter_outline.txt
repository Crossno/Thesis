Abstract

Intro

Chapter: Johnson noise thermometry
outline the basic idea and strict requirements of measuring temperature in 2D systems. Need something non-invasive, layer distinguishing, and electron/phonon distinguishing. Radiation thermometry meets all these requirements. Johnson noise is analogous to this

	Section: thermal noise in resistors
history of Johnson-Nyquist noise. Derive voltage fluctuations historically: first thermodynamically, then fluctuation dissipation, then microscopically.

Section: Johnson noise in RF circuits
derive power formulation of Johnson noise with a gamma term. argument why gamma must always be symmetric in 2 port device (transmission line in and out both terminated by R and T). Argument why noise power must be the same for any 2 devices with same 2 port R. Talk about impedance matching (not necessarily specifics but in concept). high frequency limits of Johnson noise. Probers low temperature paper.

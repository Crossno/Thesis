measurements of single electron tunneling (SET) semiconductor samples
are discussed and a two-channel cross-correlation spectrum analysis
method combined with ultralow noise detection is proposed which gives 10
mK noise temperature resolution. We emphasize the effect of the high
frequency photon radiation originating from the external circuit which
may strongly affect sub-kelvin low frequency noise measurements if not
filtered. We quantitatively show that hot photons are important as a
mechanism of activation of electron traps for semiconductor SET devices,
increasing low frequency 1/f or telegraphic noise, and as a mechanism to
increase the electronic temperature. We describe a new type of cryogenic
coaxes whose attenuation drastically thermalizes the photons. As a
check, we show for the first time resonant tunneling peak linewidths in
the Coulomb blockade regime decreasing with temperature down to ≃60
mK.},

One such system is the electron-hole plasma in graphene near the charge neutrality point which can form a strongly coupled Dirac fluid. This charge neutral plasma of quasi-relativistic fermions is expected to exhibit a substantial enhancement of the thermal conductivity, due to decoupling of charge and heat currents within hydrodynamics. Employing high sensitivity Johnson noise thermometry, we report the breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law in graphene, with a thermal conductivity an order of magnitude larger than the value predicted by Fermi liquid theory. This result is a signature of the Dirac fluid, and constitutes direct evidence of collective motion in a quantum electronic fluid.},

This theorem may be represented by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization of the familiar Langevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori. As an illustrative example, the density response problem is briefly discussed.},

I is the observed current in the thermocouple, k is Boltzmann's gas constant, T is the absolute temperature of the conductor, R(ω) is the real component of impedance of the conductor, Y(ω) is the transfer impedance of the amplifier, and ω2π=f represents frequency. The value of Boltzmann's constant obtained from the measurements lie near the accepted value of this constant. The technical aspects of the disturbance are discussed. In an amplifier having a range of 5000 cycles and the input resistance R the power equivalent of the effect is ¯V2R=0.8×10−16 watt, with corresponding power for other ranges of frequency. The least contribution of tube noise is equivalent to that of a resistance Rc=1.5×105ipμ, where ip is the space current in milliamperes and μ is the effective amplification of the tube.},

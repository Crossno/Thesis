	abstract = {We develop a high frequency, wide bandwidth radiometer operating at room temperature, which augments the traditional technique of Johnson noise thermometry for nanoscale thermal transport studies. Employing low noise amplifiers and an analog multiplier operating at 2{\textasciitilde}GHz, auto- and cross-correlated Johnson noise measurements are performed in the temperature range of 3 to 300{\textasciitilde}K, achieving a sensitivity of 5.5{\textasciitilde}mK (110 ppm) in 1 second of integration time. This setup allows us to measure the thermal conductance of a boron nitride encapsulated monolayer graphene device over a wide temperature range. Our data shows a high power law (T\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}sim4\}\$) deviation from the Wiedemann-Franz law above T\${\textbackslash}sim\$100{\textasciitilde}K.},

	abstract = {Detailed measurements of the voltage, temperature, and frequency dependence of the nonequilibrium current fluctuations for a diffusive mesoscopic conductor are reported. The data confirm predictions that a mesoscopic conductor shorter than the electron-electron inelastic length will display shot noise. Furthermore, the low temperatures (100 mK) and high frequencies (1–20 GHz) used for the measurements allow tests in the high-frequency regime (i.e., hν≫eV and kT) of the shot noise, which clearly show the influence of vacuum fluctuations. The quantum noise causes a high-frequency “cutoff” in the shot noise, i.e., the noise is independent of bias voltage for frequencies ν{\textgreater}eV/h.},

	abstract = {The linear response theory has given a general proof of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem which states that the linear response of a given system to an external perturbation is expressed in terms of fluctuation properties of the system in thermal equilibrium. This theorem may be represented by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization of the familiar Langevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori. As an illustrative example, the density response problem is briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {Statistical fluctuation of electric charge exists in all conductors, producing random variation of potential between the ends of the conductor. The effect of these fluctuations has been measured by a vacuum tube amplifier and thermocouple, and can be expressed by the formula ¯I2=(2kTπ)∫0∞R(ω){\textbar}Y(ω){\textbar}2dω. I is the observed current in the thermocouple, k is Boltzmann's gas constant, T is the absolute temperature of the conductor, R(ω) is the real component of impedance of the conductor, Y(ω) is the transfer impedance of the amplifier, and ω2π=f represents frequency. The value of Boltzmann's constant obtained from the measurements lie near the accepted value of this constant. The technical aspects of the disturbance are discussed. In an amplifier having a range of 5000 cycles and the input resistance R the power equivalent of the effect is ¯V2R=0.8×10−16 watt, with corresponding power for other ranges of frequency. The least contribution of tube noise is equivalent to that of a resistance Rc=1.5×105ipμ, where ip is the space current in milliamperes and μ is the effective amplification of the tube.},

The independence of the thermal noise from the material nature of the sensor makes it particularly attractive for metrological applications. However, the noise signals are extremely small and some ingenuity is required to make accurate measurements. This paper reviews the foundations of Johnson noise thermometry and the various techniques that have been employed to measure temperature via Johnson noise. Emphasis is placed on key developments in noise thermometers for metrological applications. The review includes the current activities of teams involved in noise thermometry research.},

	abstract = {Electrical conductivity (σ), thermopower (S), electronic thermal conductivity (κe), and Lorentz ratio (L = κe/σT) are examined for two-dimensional (2D) zero-gap systems. The bipolar-diffusion (BD) effect in 2D Dirac cones is discussed for the first time. Semiclassical calculations show that L is enhanced by a factor of 200–400\% as compared with the conventional Sommerfeld value L0 = 2.45 × 10−8 W·Ω·K−2 due to the BD effect. It is, however, shown that this enhancement is not due to the linear dispersion of the Dirac cones but due to the zero band gap and is widely expected to occur in all zero-gap systems under its charge neutrality condition. Calculations taking into account electron–hole puddles revealed that the BD effect is suppressed in pristine graphene devices affected by charged-impurity potentials.},

Weyl fermions—massless particles with half-integer spin—were once mistakenly thought to describe neutrinos. Although not yet observed among elementary particles, Weyl fermions may exist as collective excitations in so-called Weyl semimetals. These materials have an unusual band structure in which the linearly dispersing valence and conduction bands meet at discrete “Weyl points.” Xu et al. used photoemission spectroscopy to identify TaAs as a Weyl semimetal capable of hosting Weyl fermions. In a complementary study, Lu et al. detected the characteristic Weyl points in a photonic crystal. The observation of Weyl physics may enable the discovery of exotic fundamental phenomena.
Science, this issue p. 613 and 622
The massless solutions to the Dirac equation are described by the so-called Weyl Hamiltonian. The Weyl equation requires a particle to have linear dispersion in all three dimensions while being doubly degenerate at a single momentum point. These Weyl points are topological monopoles of quantized Berry flux exhibiting numerous unusual properties. We performed angle-resolved microwave transmission measurements through a double-gyroid photonic crystal with inversion-breaking where Weyl points have been theoretically predicted to occur. The excited bulk states show two linear dispersion bands touching at four isolated points in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone, indicating the observation of Weyl points. This work paves the way to a variety of photonic topological phenomena in three dimensions.
Microwave measurements are used to identify Weyl points in a double-gyroid photonic crystal. [Also see Research Article by Xu et al.]

	abstract = {Graphene has demonstrated great promise for future electronics technology as well as fundamental physics applications because of its linear energy–momentum dispersion relations which cross at the Dirac point. However, accessing the physics of the low-density region at the Dirac point has been difficult because of disorder that leaves the graphene with local microscopic electron and hole puddles. Efforts have been made to reduce the disorder by suspending graphene, leading to fabrication challenges and delicate devices which make local spectroscopic measurements difficult. Recently, it has been shown that placing graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) yields improved device performance. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to show that graphene conforms to hBN, as evidenced by the presence of Moiré patterns. However, contrary to predictions, this conformation does not lead to a sizeable band gap because of the misalignment of the lattices. Moreover, local spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the electron–hole charge fluctuations are reduced by two orders of magnitude as compared with those on silicon oxide. This leads to charge fluctuations that are as small as in suspended graphene, opening up Dirac point physics to more diverse experiments.},

	abstract = {We describe the nature of charge transport at nonzero temperatures (T) above the two-dimensional (d) superfluid-insulator quantum-critical point. We argue that the transport is characterized by inelastic collisions among thermally excited carriers at a rate of order kBT/ħ. This implies that the transport at frequencies ω≪kBT/ħ is in the hydrodynamic, collision-dominated (or incoherent) regime, while ω≫kBT/ħ is the collisionless (or phase-coherent) regime. The conductivity is argued to be e2/h times a nontrivial universal scaling function of ħω/kBT, and not independent of ħω/kBT, as has been previously claimed or implicitly assumed. The experimentally measured dc conductivity is the hydrodynamic ħω/kBT→0 limit of this function, and is a universal number times e2/h, even though the transport is incoherent. Previous work determined the conductivity by incorrectly assuming it was also equal to the collisionless ħω/kBT→∞ limit of the scaling function, which actually describes phase-coherent transport with a conductivity given by a different universal number times e2/h. We provide a computation of the universal dc conductivity in a disorder-free boson model, along with explicit crossover functions, using a quantum Boltzmann equation and an expansion in ε=3−d. The case of spin transport near quantum-critical points in antiferromagnets is also discussed. Similar ideas should apply to the transitions in quantum Hall systems and to metal-insulator transitions. We suggest experimental tests of our picture and speculate on a route to self-duality at two-dimensional quantum-critical points.},

The surface state of a Weyl semimetal displays pairs of entangled Fermi arcs at two opposite surfaces. However, the existence of Weyl semimetals has not yet been proved experimentally. Here, we report the experimental realization of a Weyl semimetal in TaAs by observing Fermi arcs formed by its surface states using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.

Using the Keldysh technique combined with standard impurity averaging methods in the regime kFl≫1 (where kF is the Fermi wave vector and l is the mean free path), we consider both scalar potential (i.e., deformation potential) and vector-potential couplings between electrons and phonons. We also consider the effects of electronic screening at the Thomas-Fermi level. We find that the temperature dependence of the heat flux and thermal conductance is sensitive to the presence of disorder and screening, and reflects the underlying chiral nature of electrons in graphene and the corresponding modification of their diffusive behavior. In the case of weak screening, disorder enhances the low-temperature heat flux over the clean system (changing the associated power law from T4 to T3), and the deformation potential dominates. For strong screening, both the deformation potential and vector-potential couplings make comparable contributions, and the low-temperature heat flux obeys a T5 power law.},

The various instrumental errors are analysed and it is shown that operation with the instrument simultaneously balanced in two different frequency ranges results in the automatic elimination of some of these, allowing a precision of 1 in 105, equivalent to 1 mK at 100 K, to be approached, subject to the requirement of lengthy averaging for the reduction of statistical uncertainty. Preliminary results, based on the assumption of negligible difference between the IPTS-68 and the thermodynamic scale at the reference temperature, show the difference T - T68 to be + 3 mK at 90.17 K and + 8 mK at 97 K. The standard deviations of these differences are 3 mK and 4 mK respectively. Recent gas thermometry at NBS indicates that the IPTS-68 temperature may be significantly higher than the corresponding thermodynamic one at the reference temperature and if this is taken into account the noise thermometer result is in close numerical agreement with the IPTS-68 value for the oxygen boiling point.},

We use this formalism to compute transport coefficients in the Dirac fluid in clean samples of graphene near the charge neutrality point, and find results insensitive to long-range Coulomb interactions. Numerical results are compared to recent experimental data on thermal and electrical conductivity in the Dirac fluid in graphene and a substantially improved quantitative agreement over existing hydrodynamic theories is found. We comment on the interplay between the Dirac fluid and acoustic and optical phonons, and qualitatively explain the experimentally observed effects. Our work paves the way for quantitative contact between experimentally realized condensed matter systems and the wide body of high-energy inspired theories on transport in interacting many-body quantum systems.},

	abstract = {Johnson noise thermometers (JNT) measure the equilibrium electrical noise, proportional to thermodynamic temperature, of a sensing resistor. In the correlation method, the same resistor is connected to two amplifiers and a correlation of their outputs is performed, in order to reject amplifiers' noise. Such rejection is not perfect: the residual correlation gives a systematic error in the JNT reading. In order to put an upper limit, or to achieve a correction, for such error, a careful electrical modelling of the amplifiers and connections must be performed. Standard numerical simulation tools are inadequate for such modelling. In literature, evaluations have been performed by the painstaking solving of analytical modelling. We propose an evaluation procedure for the JNT error due to residual correlations which blends analytical and numerical approaches, with the benefits of both: a rigorous and accurate circuit noise modelling, and a fast and flexible evaluation with an user-friendly commercial tool. The method is applied to a simple but very effective ultralow-noise amplifier employed in a working JNT.},

	abstract = {Electrons that flow like a fluid
Electrons inside a conductor are often described as flowing in response to an electric field. This flow rarely resembles anything like the familiar flow of water through a pipe, but three groups describe counterexamples (see the Perspective by Zaanen). Moll et al. found that the viscosity of the electron fluid in thin wires of PdCoO2 had a major effect on the flow, much like what happens in regular fluids. Bandurin et al. found evidence in graphene of electron whirlpools similar to those formed by viscous fluid flowing through a small opening. Finally, Crossno et al. observed a huge increase of thermal transport in graphene, a signature of so-called Dirac fluids.
Science, this issue p. 1061, 1055, 1058; see also p. 1026
Electron transport is conventionally determined by the momentum-relaxing scattering of electrons by the host solid and its excitations. Hydrodynamic fluid flow through channels, in contrast, is determined partly by the viscosity of the fluid, which is governed by momentum-conserving internal collisions. A long-standing question in the physics of solids has been whether the viscosity of the electron fluid plays an observable role in determining the resistance. We report experimental evidence that the resistance of restricted channels of the ultrapure two-dimensional metal palladium cobaltate (PdCoO2) has a large viscous contribution. Comparison with theory allows an estimate of the electronic viscosity in the range between 6 × 10–3 kg m–1 s–1 and 3 × 10–4 kg m–1 s–1, versus 1 × 10–3 kg m–1 s–1 for water at room temperature.
Transport measurements in thin wires of PdCoO2 reveal a regime wherein electron-electron collisions play a major role. [Also see Perspective by Zaanen]

Weyl fermions—massless particles with half-integer spin—were once mistakenly thought to describe neutrinos. Although not yet observed among elementary particles, Weyl fermions may exist as collective excitations in so-called Weyl semimetals. These materials have an unusual band structure in which the linearly dispersing valence and conduction bands meet at discrete “Weyl points.” Xu et al. used photoemission spectroscopy to identify TaAs as a Weyl semimetal capable of hosting Weyl fermions. In a complementary study, Lu et al. detected the characteristic Weyl points in a photonic crystal. The observation of Weyl physics may enable the discovery of exotic fundamental phenomena.
Science, this issue p. 613 and 622
A Weyl semimetal is a new state of matter that hosts Weyl fermions as emergent quasiparticles and admits a topological classification that protects Fermi arc surface states on the boundary of a bulk sample. This unusual electronic structure has deep analogies with particle physics and leads to unique topological properties. We report the experimental discovery of a Weyl semimetal, tantalum arsenide (TaAs). Using photoemission spectroscopy, we directly observe Fermi arcs on the surface, as well as the Weyl fermion cones and Weyl nodes in the bulk of TaAs single crystals. We find that Fermi arcs terminate on the Weyl fermion nodes, consistent with their topological character. Our work opens the field for the experimental study of Weyl fermions in physics and materials science.
Angle-resolved photoemission is used to detect the topological surface states and bulk dispersion of the compound tantalum arsenide. [Also see Report by Lu et al.]

In particular, we design “invasive” probes crossing the whole graphene sheet as well as “external” probes connected through graphene side arms. The four-probe conductance measured between external probes varies linearly with charge density and is symmetric between electron and hole types of carriers. In contrast measurements with invasive probes give a strong electron-hole asymmetry and a sublinear conductance as a function of density. By comparing various geometries and types of contact metal, we show that these two observations are due to transport properties of the metal/graphene interface. The asymmetry originates from the pinning of the charge density below the metal, which thereby forms a p−n or p−p junction, depending on the polarity of the carriers in the bulk graphene sheet. Our results also explain part of the sublinearity observed in conductance as a function of density in a large number of experiments on graphene, which has generally been attributed to short-range scattering only.},

We present a review of this development focusing on shot noise in small electric conductors. Shot noise is a consequence of the quantization of charge.

In particular, shot noise experiments can determine the charge and statistics of the quasiparticles relevant for transport, and reveal information on the potential profile and internal energy scales of mesoscopic systems. Shot noise is generally more sensitive to the effects of electron-electron interactions than the average conductance. We present a discussion based on the conceptually transparent scattering approach and on the classical Langevin and Boltzmann-Langevin methods; in addition a discussion of results which cannot be obtained by these methods is provided. We conclude the review by pointing out a number of unsolved problems and an outlook on the likely future development of the field.},

In the quantum-critical regime μ≲T we find pronounced deviations from Fermi-liquid behavior, such as a collective cyclotron resonance with an intrinsic collision-broadened width and significant enhancements of the Mott and Wiedemann-Franz ratios. Some of these results have been anticipated by a relativistic hydrodynamic theory, whose precise range of validity and failure at large fields and frequencies we determine. The Boltzmann approach allows us to go beyond the hydrodynamic regime and to quantitatively describe the deviations from magnetohydrodynamics and the crossover to disorder-dominated Fermi-liquid behavior at large doping and low temperatures, as well as the crossover to the ballistic regime at high fields. Finally, we obtain the full frequency and doping dependence of the single universal conductivity σQ which parametrizes the hydrodynamic response.},

Recent demonstrations of electrical-gate control in spin-transistor configurations have shown great promise, but operation at room temperature remains elusive. Further progress requires a deeper understanding of the propagation of spin polarization, particularly in the high-mobility semiconductors used for devices. Here we report the application of Doppler velocimetry to resolve the motion of spin-polarized electrons in GaAs quantum wells driven by a drifting Fermi sea. We find that the spin mobility tracks the high electron mobility precisely as a function of temperature. However, we also observe that the coherent precession of spins driven by spin–orbit interaction, which is essential for the operation of a broad class of spin logic devices, breaks down at temperatures above 150 K, for reasons that are not yet understood theoretically.

	abstract = {Electrons that flow like a fluid
Electrons inside a conductor are often described as flowing in response to an electric field. This flow rarely resembles anything like the familiar flow of water through a pipe, but three groups describe counterexamples (see the Perspective by Zaanen). Moll et al. found that the viscosity of the electron fluid in thin wires of PdCoO2 had a major effect on the flow, much like what happens in regular fluids. Bandurin et al. found evidence in graphene of electron whirlpools similar to those formed by viscous fluid flowing through a small opening. Finally, Crossno et al. observed a huge increase of thermal transport in graphene, a signature of so-called Dirac fluids.
Science, this issue p. 1061, 1055, 1058; see also p. 1026
Interactions between particles in quantum many-body systems can lead to collective behavior described by hydrodynamics. One such system is the electron-hole plasma in graphene near the charge-neutrality point, which can form a strongly coupled Dirac fluid. This charge-neutral plasma of quasi-relativistic fermions is expected to exhibit a substantial enhancement of the thermal conductivity, thanks to decoupling of charge and heat currents within hydrodynamics. Employing high-sensitivity Johnson noise thermometry, we report an order of magnitude increase in the thermal conductivity and the breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the thermally populated charge-neutral plasma in graphene. This result is a signature of the Dirac fluid and constitutes direct evidence of collective motion in a quantum electronic fluid.
Thermal transport is enhanced near the charge-neutrality point in graphene, owing to the dominant interelectron interactions. [Also see Perspective by Zaanen]

However, the noise signals are extremely small and some ingenuity is required to make accurate measurements. This paper reviews the foundations of Johnson noise thermometry and the various techniques that have been employed to measure temperature via Johnson noise. Emphasis is placed on key developments in noise thermometers for metrological applications. The review includes the current activities of teams involved in noise thermometry research.},

	abstract = {The Wiedemann-Franz law, connecting the electronic thermal conductivity to the electrical conductivity of a disordered metal, is generally found to be well satisfied even when electron-electron (e−e) interactions are strong. In ultraclean conductors in the hydrodynamic regime, however, large deviations from the standard form of the law are expected, due to the fact that e−e interactions affect the two conductivities in radically different ways. Thus, the standard Wiedemann-Franz ratio between the thermal and the electric conductivity is reduced by a factor 1+τ/τeeth, where 1/τ is the momentum relaxation rate and τeeth is the relaxation time of the thermal current due to e−e collisions. Here we study the density and temperature dependence of 1/τeeth of two-dimensional electron liquids. We show that at low temperature 1/τeeth is 8/5 of the quasiparticle decay rate; remarkably, the same result is found in doped graphene and in conventional electron liquids in parabolic bands.},

Here, we present measurements of bipolar thermal conductances due to electron diffusion and electron-phonon coupling and infer the electronic specific heat, with a minimum value of 10kB (10−22 J/K) per square micron. We test the validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law and find that the Lorenz number equals 1.32×(π2/3)(kB/e)2. The electron-phonon thermal conductance has a temperature power law T2 at high doping levels, and the coupling parameter is consistent with recent theory, indicating its enhancement by impurity scattering. We demonstrate control of the thermal conductance by electrical gating and by suppressing the diffusion channel using NbTiN superconducting electrodes, which sets the stage for future graphene-based single-microwave photon detection.},

In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white.

This effect is expected to occur in a single-layer graphene embedded in a dielectric medium. Its dependence on the dielectric constant is calculated analytically.},

Their dynamic response, however, is little known at frequencies above one terahertz (THz). Such knowledge is important not only for a deeper understanding of the Dirac electron quantum transport, but also for graphene applications in ultrahigh-speed THz electronics and infrared (IR) optoelectronics. In this paper, we report measurements of high-frequency conductivity of graphene from THz to mid-IR at different carrier concentrations. The conductivity exhibits Drude-like frequency dependence and increases dramatically at THz frequencies, but its absolute strength is lower than theoretical predictions. This anomalous reduction of free-electron oscillator strength is corroborated by corresponding changes in graphene interband transitions, as required by the sum rule.},

In the small amplitude limit, our results are consistent with the memory function prediction for the momentum relaxation rate.

	abstract = {At low temperatures, the electron gas of graphene is expected to show both very weak coupling to thermal baths and rapid thermalization, properties which are desirable for use as a sensitive bolometer. We demonstrate an ultrasensitive, wide-bandwidth measurement scheme based on Johnson noise to probe the thermal-transport and thermodynamic properties of the electron gas of graphene, with a resolution of 2 mK/√Hz and a bandwidth of 80 MHz. We have measured the electron-phonon coupling directly through energy transport, from 2–30 K and at a charge density of 2×1011 cm−2. We demonstrate bolometric mixing and utilize this effect to sense temperature oscillations with a period of 430 ps and determine the heat capacity of the electron gas to be 2×10−21 J/(K⋅μm2) at 5 K, which is consistent with that of a two-dimensional Dirac electron gas. These measurements suggest that graphene-based devices, together with wide-bandwidth noise thermometry, can generate substantial advances in the areas of ultrasensitive bolometry, calorimetry, microwave and terahertz photo-detection, and bolometric mixing for applications in fields such as observational astronomy and quantum information and measurement.},

Employing an electrolytic gate, we demonstrate that n can be adjusted up to 4×1014 cm−2 for both electrons and holes. The measured sample resistivity ρ increases linearly with temperature T in the high temperature limit, indicating that a quasiclassical phonon distribution is responsible for the electron scattering. As T decreases, the resistivity decreases more rapidly following ρ(T)∼T4. This low temperature behavior can be described by a Bloch-Grüneisen model taking into account the quantum distribution of the two-dimensional acoustic phonons in graphene. We map out the density dependence of the characteristic temperature ΘBG defining the crossover between the two distinct regimes, and show that, for all n, ρ(T) scales as a universal function of the normalized temperature T/ΘBG.},

For dirty samples (250 × 1010 cm−2 {\textless} n imp {\textless} 400 × 1010 cm−2), the value of the minimum conductivity at low carrier density is indeed 4e 2/h in agreement with early experiments, with weak dependence on impurity concentration. For cleaner samples, we predict that the minimum conductivity depends strongly on n imp, increasing to 8e 2/h for n imp ≈ 20 × 1010 cm−2. A clear strategy to improve graphene mobility is to eliminate charged impurities or use a substrate with a larger dielectric constant.},

	abstract = {The cooling of hot electrons in graphene is the critical process underlying the operation of exciting new graphene-based optoelectronic and plasmonic devices, but the nature of this cooling is controversial. We extract the hot-electron cooling rate near the Fermi level by using graphene as a novel photothermal thermometer that measures the electron temperature (T(t)) as it cools dynamically. We find the photocurrent generated from graphene p–n junctions is well described by the energy dissipation rate CdT/dt = −A(T3−Tl3), where the heat capacity is C = αT and Tl is the base lattice temperature. These results are in disagreement with predictions of electron–phonon emission in a disorder-free graphene system, but in excellent quantitative agreement with recent predictions of a disorder-enhanced supercollision cooling mechanism. We find that the supercollision model provides a complete and unified picture of energy loss near the Fermi level over the wide range of electronic (15 to {\textasciitilde} 3,000 K) and lattice (10–295 K) temperatures investigated.

Many previous transport computations in strongly coupled systems are interpretable hydrodynamically, despite formally going beyond the hydrodynamic regime. This includes momentum relaxation times previously derived by the memory matrix formalism, and non-perturbative holographic results; in the latter case, this is subject to some important subtleties. Our formalism may extend some memory matrix computations to higher orders in the perturbative disorder strength, as well as give valuable insight into non-perturbative regimes. Strongly coupled metals with quantum critical contributions to transport generically transition between coherent and incoherent metals as disorder strength is increased at fixed temperature, analogous to mean field holographic treatments of disorder. From a condensed matter perspective, our theory generalizes the resistor network approximation, and associated variational techniques, to strongly interacting systems where momentum is long lived.},

We offer an experimental answer by describing electron transport in suspended devices with carrier mobilities of several 106 cm2 V–1 s–1 and with the onset of Landau quantization occurring in fields below 5 mT. The observed charge inhomogeneity is as low as ≈108 cm–2, allowing a neutral state with a few charge carriers per entire micrometer-scale device. Above liquid helium temperatures, the electronic properties of such devices are intrinsic, being governed by thermal excitations only. This yields that the Dirac point can be approached within 1 meV, a limit currently set by the remaining charge inhomogeneity. No sign of an insulating state is observed down to 1 K, which establishes the upper limit on a possible bandgap.},

	abstract = {When electrons are confined in two-dimensional materials, quantum-mechanically enhanced transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect can be observed. Graphene, consisting of an isolated single atomic layer of graphite, is an ideal realization of such a two-dimensional system. However, its behaviour is expected to differ markedly from the well-studied case of quantum wells in conventional semiconductor interfaces. This difference arises from the unique electronic properties of graphene, which exhibits electron–hole degeneracy and vanishing carrier mass near the point of charge neutrality. Indeed, a distinctive half-integer quantum Hall effect has been predicted theoretically, as has the existence of a non-zero Berry's phase (a geometric quantum phase) of the electron wavefunction—a consequence of the exceptional topology of the graphene band structure. Recent advances in micromechanical extraction and fabrication techniques for graphite structures now permit such exotic two-dimensional electron systems to be probed experimentally. Here we report an experimental investigation of magneto-transport in a high-mobility single layer of graphene. Adjusting the chemical potential with the use of the electric field effect, we observe an unusual half-integer quantum Hall effect for both electron and hole carriers in graphene. The relevance of Berry's phase to these experiments is confirmed by magneto-oscillations. In addition to their purely scientific interest, these unusual quantum transport phenomena may lead to new applications in carbon-based electronic and magneto-electronic devices.},

	abstract = {Carrier mobility in solids is generally limited by electron-impurity or electron–phonon scattering, depending on the most frequently occurring event. Three-body collisions between carriers and both phonons and impurities are rare; they are denoted supercollisions. Elusive in electronic transport they should emerge in relaxation processes as they allow for larger energy transfers. This is the case in undoped graphene, where the small Fermi surface drastically restricts the allowed phonon energy in ordinary collisions. Using electrical heating and sensitive noise thermometry we report on supercollision cooling in diffusive monolayer graphene. At low carrier density and high phonon temperature the Joule power P obeys a P Te3 law as a function of electronic temperature Te. It overrules the linear law expected for ordinary collisions which has recently been observed in resistivity measurements. The cubic law is characteristic of supercollisions and departs from the Te4 dependence recently reported for doped graphene below the Bloch–Grüneisen temperature. These supercollisions are important for applications of graphene in bolometry and photo-detection.

We analyze alternative cooling pathways mediated by `supercollisions' that have lower frequency but transfer higher energy than normal collisions. We demonstrate that supercollisions, such as disorder-assisted phonon scattering and two-phonon scattering, can dominate over momentum-conserving channels under realistic conditions. In the disorder-assisted regime, the cooling rate can be changed by orders of magnitude by varying the amount of disorder. This opens the way for using graphene as a platform in a variety of applications that rely on hot-carrier transport. Anomalous sensitivity to disorder and sign reversal of the temperature dependence can serve as a diagnostic of this new energy transport regime.},

In the general case we evaluate the heat current numerically. We suggest that a measurement of the heat current could be used for an experimental determination of the electron-acoustic-phonon coupling constants, which are not accurately known. However, in a typical experiment heat dissipation by electrons at very low temperatures is dominated by diffusion and we estimate the crossover temperature at which acoustic-phonon coupling takes over in a sample with Joule heating. At even higher temperatures optical phonons begin to dominate. We study some examples of potentially relevant types of optical modes, including, in particular, the intrinsic in-plane modes and additionally the remote surface phonons of a possible dielectric substrate.},

Electrons on the atomic scale do not exhibit such symmetry, which can only be generated as a collective phenomenon through the interactions between a large number of electrons. In materials with strong electron correlations a quantum phase transition at zero temperature can occur, and a quantum critical state has been predicted, which manifests itself through universal power-law behaviours of the response functions. Candidates have been found both in heavy-fermion systems and in the high-transition temperature (high-Tc) copper oxide superconductors, but the reality and the physical nature of such a phase transition are still debated. Here we report a universal behaviour that is characteristic of the quantum critical region. We demonstrate that the experimentally measured phase angle agrees precisely with the exponent of the optical conductivity. This points towards a quantum phase transition of an unconventional kind in the high-Tc superconductors.},

However, investigation of these phenomena has been hampered by the lack of known macroscopic signatures of electron viscosity. Here we identify vorticity as such a signature and link it with a readily verifiable striking macroscopic d.c. transport behaviour. Produced by the viscous flow, vorticity can drive electric current against an applied field, resulting in a negative nonlocal voltage. We argue that the latter may play the same role for the viscous regime as zero electrical resistance does for superconductivity. Besides offering a diagnostic that distinguishes viscous transport from ohmic currents, the sign-changing electrical response affords a robust tool for directly measuring the viscosity-to-resistivity ratio. A strongly interacting electron–hole plasma in high-mobility graphene affords a unique link between quantum-critical electron transport and the wealth of fluid mechanics phenomena.},

For a perfect graphene sheet free from impurities and disorder, the Fermi energy lies at the so-called 'Dirac point', where the density of electronic states vanishes. But in the inevitable presence of disorder, theory predicts that equally probable regions of electron-rich and hole-rich puddles will arise. These puddles could explain graphene's anomalous non-zero minimal conductivity at zero average carrier density. Here, we use a scanning single-electron transistor to map the local density of states and the carrier density landscape in the vicinity of the neutrality point. Our results confirm the existence of electron–hole puddles, and rule out extrinsic substrate effects as explanations for their emergence and topology. Moreover, we find that, unlike non-relativistic particles the density of states can be quantitatively accounted for by considering non-interacting electrons and holes.},

Independent calculations via Einstein-Maxwell dilaton holography and memory matrix methods lead to the same results. We show that random-field disorder has a strong effect on resistivity and leads to a short relaxation time for the total momentum. In the course of our holographic calculation, we use a nontrivial dilaton coupling to the disordered scalar, allowing us to study a strongly coupled scale-invariant theory with θ≠0. Using holography, we are also able to determine the disorder strength at which perturbation theory breaks down. Curiously, for locally critical theories, this breakdown occurs when the resistivity is proportional to the entropy density, up to a possible logarithmic correction.},

We allow for a weak impurity scattering rate, a magnetic field B, and a deviation in the density ρ from that of the insulator. We show that the frequency-dependent thermal and electric linear response functions, including the Nernst coefficient, are fully determined by a single transport coefficient (a universal electrical conductivity), the impurity scattering rate, and a few thermodynamic state variables. With reasonable estimates for the parameters, our results predict a magnetic field and temperature dependence of the Nernst signal which resembles measurements in the cuprates, including the overall magnitude. Our theory predicts a “hydrodynamic cyclotron mode” which could be observable in ultrapure samples. We also present exact results for the zero frequency transport coefficients of a supersymmetric conformal field theory (CFT), which is solvable by the anti–de Sitter (AdS)/CFT correspondence. This correspondence maps the ρ and B perturbations of the 2+1 dimensional CFT to electric and magnetic charges of a black hole in the 3+1 dimensional anti–de Sitter space. These exact results are found to be in full agreement with the general predictions of our hydrodynamic analysis in the appropriate limiting regime. The mapping of the hydrodynamic and AdS/CFT results under particle-vortex duality is also described.},

Here, we go beyond the mean-field theory and investigate the role of Kondo fluctuations on the topological surface states.

At low temperatures, the viscosity has a universal quantum scale ħ n, where n is the density and ħ is Planck’s constant h divided by 2π, whereas at high temperatures the natural scale is pT3/ħ2, where pT is the thermal momentum. We used breathing mode damping to measure the shear viscosity at low temperature. At high temperature T, we used anisotropic expansion of the cloud to find the viscosity, which exhibits precise T3/2 scaling. In both experiments, universal hydrodynamic equations including friction and heating were used to extract the viscosity. We estimate the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density and compare it with that of a perfect fluid.

	abstract = {An electron propagating through a solid carries spin angular momentum in addition to its mass and charge. Of late there has been considerable interest in developing electronic devices based on the transport of spin that offer potential advantages in dissipation, size and speed over charge-based devices. However, these advantages bring with them additional complexity. Because each electron carries a single, fixed value (- e) of charge, the electrical current carried by a gas of electrons is simply proportional to its total momentum. A fundamental consequence is that the charge current is not affected by interactions that conserve total momentum, notably collisions among the electrons themselves. In contrast, the electron's spin along a given spatial direction can take on two values, /2 (conventionally ,), so that the spin current and momentum need not be proportional. Although the transport of spin polarization is not protected by momentum conservation, it has been widely assumed that, like the charge current, spin current is unaffected by electron–electron (e–e) interactions. Here we demonstrate experimentally not only that this assumption is invalid, but also that over a broad range of temperature and electron density, the flow of spin polarization in a two-dimensional gas of electrons is controlled by the rate of e–e collisions.},

	abstract = {In an ideal graphene sheet, charge carriers behave as two-dimensional Dirac fermions. This has been confirmed by the discovery of a half-integer quantum Hall effect in graphene flakes placed on a SiO2 substrate. The Dirac fermions in graphene, however, are subject to microscopic perturbations that include topographic corrugations and electron-density inhomogeneities (that is, charge puddles). Such perturbations profoundly alter Dirac-fermion behaviour, with implications for their fundamental physics as well as for future graphene device applications. Here we report a new technique of Dirac-point mapping that we have used to determine the origin of charge inhomogeneities in graphene. We find that fluctuations in graphene charge density are caused not by topographical corrugations, but rather by charge-donating impurities below the graphene. These impurities induce surprising standing wave patterns due to unexpected backscattering of Dirac fermions. Such wave patterns can be continuously modulated by electric gating. Our observations provide new insight into impurity scattering of Dirac fermions and the microscopic mechanisms limiting electronic mobility in graphene.},

Thus, graphene can be useful in solving heat dissipation problems such as those in nanoelectronics. However, contact with a substrate could affect the thermal transport properties of graphene. Here, we show experimentally that κ of monolayer graphene exfoliated on a silicon dioxide support is still as high as about 600 watts per meter per kelvin near room temperature, exceeding those of metals such as copper. It is lower than that of suspended graphene because of phonons leaking across the graphene-support interface and strong interface-scattering of flexural modes, which make a large contribution to κ in suspended graphene according to a theoretical calculation.
The thermal conductivity of graphene supported on silicon dioxide remains high, despite phonon scattering by the substrate.

	abstract = {Quantum electrodynamics (resulting from the merger of quantum mechanics and relativity theory) has provided a clear understanding of phenomena ranging from particle physics to cosmology and from astrophysics to quantum chemistry. The ideas underlying quantum electrodynamics also influence the theory of condensed matter, but quantum relativistic effects are usually minute in the known experimental systems that can be described accurately by the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation. Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective 'speed of light' c* 106 m s-1. Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass mc of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = mcc*2. This two-dimensional system is not only interesting in itself but also allows access to the subtle and rich physics of quantum electrodynamics in a bench-top experiment.},

Until now, the hot carrier dynamics in graphene could only be accessed indirectly. Here, we present a dynamical view on the Dirac cone by time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.

	abstract = {Electrons that flow like a fluid
Electrons inside a conductor are often described as flowing in response to an electric field. This flow rarely resembles anything like the familiar flow of water through a pipe, but three groups describe counterexamples (see the Perspective by Zaanen). Moll et al. found that the viscosity of the electron fluid in thin wires of PdCoO2 had a major effect on the flow, much like what happens in regular fluids. Bandurin et al. found evidence in graphene of electron whirlpools similar to those formed by viscous fluid flowing through a small opening. Finally, Crossno et al. observed a huge increase of thermal transport in graphene, a signature of so-called Dirac fluids.
Science, this issue p. 1061, 1055, 1058; see also p. 1026
Graphene hosts a unique electron system in which electron-phonon scattering is extremely weak but electron-electron collisions are sufficiently frequent to provide local equilibrium above the temperature of liquid nitrogen. Under these conditions, electrons can behave as a viscous liquid and exhibit hydrodynamic phenomena similar to classical liquids. Here we report strong evidence for this transport regime. We found that doped graphene exhibits an anomalous (negative) voltage drop near current-injection contacts, which is attributed to the formation of submicrometer-size whirlpools in the electron flow. The viscosity of graphene’s electron liquid is found to be {\textasciitilde}0.1 square meters per second, an order of magnitude higher than that of honey, in agreement with many-body theory. Our work demonstrates the possibility of studying electron hydrodynamics using high-quality graphene.

Specifically, we decompose each conductivity into the sum of a coherent contribution due to momentum relaxation and an incoherent contribution, due to intrinsic current relaxation. This decomposition is different from those previously proposed, and is consistent with the known hydrodynamic properties in the translationally invariant limit.

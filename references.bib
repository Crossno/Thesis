measurements of single electron tunneling (SET) semiconductor samples
are discussed and a two-channel cross-correlation spectrum analysis
method combined with ultralow noise detection is proposed which gives 10
mK noise temperature resolution. We emphasize the effect of the high
frequency photon radiation originating from the external circuit which
may strongly affect sub-kelvin low frequency noise measurements if not
filtered. We quantitatively show that hot photons are important as a
mechanism of activation of electron traps for semiconductor SET devices,
increasing low frequency 1/f or telegraphic noise, and as a mechanism to
increase the electronic temperature. We describe a new type of cryogenic
coaxes whose attenuation drastically thermalizes the photons. As a
check, we show for the first time resonant tunneling peak linewidths in
the Coulomb blockade regime decreasing with temperature down to ≃60
mK.},

For acoustic phonons, we show how the temperature-power laws of the electron-phonon heat current for BLG differ from those previously derived for MLG and note that the high-temperature (neutral-regime) power laws for MLG and BLG are also different, with a weaker dependence on the electronic temperature in the latter. In the general case we evaluate the heat current numerically. We suggest that a measurement of the heat current could be used for an experimental determination of the electron-acoustic-phonon coupling constants, which are not accurately known. However, in a typical experiment heat dissipation by electrons at very low temperatures is dominated by diffusion and we estimate the crossover temperature at which acoustic-phonon coupling takes over in a sample with Joule heating. At even higher temperatures optical phonons begin to dominate. We study some examples of potentially relevant types of optical modes, including, in particular, the intrinsic in-plane modes and additionally the remote surface phonons of a possible dielectric substrate.},

Using the Keldysh technique combined with standard impurity averaging methods in the regime kFl≫1 (where kF is the Fermi wave vector and l is the mean free path), we consider both scalar potential (i.e., deformation potential) and vector-potential couplings between electrons and phonons. We also consider the effects of electronic screening at the Thomas-Fermi level. We find that the temperature dependence of the heat flux and thermal conductance is sensitive to the presence of disorder and screening, and reflects the underlying chiral nature of electrons in graphene and the corresponding modification of their diffusive behavior. In the case of weak screening, disorder enhances the low-temperature heat flux over the clean system (changing the associated power law from T4 to T3), and the deformation potential dominates. For strong screening, both the deformation potential and vector-potential couplings make comparable contributions, and the low-temperature heat flux obeys a T5 power law.},

	abstract = {The ability to transport energy is a fundamental property of the two-dimensional Dirac fermions in graphene. Electronic thermal transport in this system is relatively unexplored and is expected to show unique fundamental properties and to play an important role in future applications of graphene, including optoelectronics, plasmonics, and ultrasensitive bolometry. Here, we present measurements of bipolar thermal conductances due to electron diffusion and electron-phonon coupling and infer the electronic specific heat, with a minimum value of 10kB (10−22 J/K) per square micron. We test the validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law and find that the Lorenz number equals 1.32×(π2/3)(kB/e)2. The electron-phonon thermal conductance has a temperature power law T2 at high doping levels, and the coupling parameter is consistent with recent theory, indicating its enhancement by impurity scattering. We demonstrate control of the thermal conductance by electrical gating and by suppressing the diffusion channel using NbTiN superconducting electrodes, which sets the stage for future graphene-based single-microwave photon detection.},

Employing high sensitivity Johnson noise thermometry, we report the breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law in graphene, with a thermal conductivity an order of magnitude larger than the value predicted by Fermi liquid theory.

Applications such as thermal management, photodetection, light emission, data communication, high-speed electronics and light harvesting require a thorough understanding of (nanoscale) heat flow. Here, using time-resolved photocurrent measurements we identify a surprisingly efficient out-of-plane energy transfer channel, where charge carriers in graphene couple to hyperbolic phonon polaritons in the encapsulating layered material. This hyperbolic cooling is particularly efficient - giving picosecond cooling times - for hexagonal BN, where the high-momentum hyperbolic phonon polaritons enable efficient near-field energy transfer. We study this heat transfer mechanism through distinct control knobs, such as carrier density and lattice temperature, and find excellent agreement with theory without any adjustable parameters. These insights will lead to the ability to control heat flow in van der Waals heterostructures.},

	abstract = {We use first-principles calculations, at the density-functional-theory (DFT) and GW levels, to study both the electron-phonon interaction for acoustic phonons and the “synthetic” vector potential induced by a strain deformation (responsible for an effective magnetic field in case of a nonuniform strain). In particular, the interactions between electrons and acoustic phonon modes, the so-called gauge-field and deformation potential, are calculated at the DFT level in the framework of linear response. The zero-momentum limit of acoustic phonons is interpreted as a strain of the crystal unit cell, allowing the calculation of the acoustic gauge-field parameter (synthetic vector potential) within the GW approximation as well. We find that using an accurate model for the polarizations of the acoustic phonon modes is crucial to obtain correct numerical results. Similarly, in the presence of a strain deformation, the relaxation of atomic internal coordinates cannot be neglected. The role of electronic screening on the electron-phonon matrix elements is carefully investigated. We then solve the Boltzmann equation semianalytically in graphene, including both acoustic and optical phonon scattering. We show that, in the Bloch-Grüneisen and equipartition regimes, the electronic transport is mainly ruled by the unscreened acoustic gauge field, while the contribution due to the deformation potential is negligible and strongly screened. We show that the contribution of acoustic phonons to resistivity is doping and substrate independent, in agreement with experimental observations. The first-principles calculations, even at the GW level, underestimate this contribution to resistivity by ≈30\%. At high temperature (T{\textgreater}270 K), the calculated resistivity underestimates the experimental one more severely, the underestimation being larger at lower doping. We show that, besides remote phonon scattering, a possible explanation for this disagreement is the electron-electron interaction that strongly renormalizes the coupling to intrinsic optical-phonon modes. Finally, after discussing the validity of the Matthiessen rule in graphene, we derive simplified forms of the Boltzmann equation in the presence of impurities and in a restricted range of temperatures. These simplified analytical solutions allow us the extract the coupling to acoustic phonons, related to the strain-induced synthetic vector potential, directly from experimental data.},

	abstract = {The cooling of hot electrons in graphene is the critical process underlying the operation of exciting new graphene-based optoelectronic and plasmonic devices, but the nature of this cooling is controversial. We extract the hot-electron cooling rate near the Fermi level by using graphene as a novel photothermal thermometer that measures the electron temperature (T(t)) as it cools dynamically. We find the photocurrent generated from graphene p–n junctions is well described by the energy dissipation rate CdT/dt = −A(T3−Tl3), where the heat capacity is C = αT and Tl is the base lattice temperature. These results are in disagreement with predictions of electron–phonon emission in a disorder-free graphene system, but in excellent quantitative agreement with recent predictions of a disorder-enhanced supercollision cooling mechanism. We find that the supercollision model provides a complete and unified picture of energy loss near the Fermi level over the wide range of electronic (15 to {\textasciitilde} 3,000 K) and lattice (10–295 K) temperatures investigated.

For a disordered conductor with impurity scattering, it is shown how the shot noise crosses over from zero in the ballistic regime to one-third of the Poisson noise in the diffusive regime. In a conductor consisting of n tunnel barriers in series, the shot noise approaches one-third of the Poisson noise as n goes to infinity, independent of the transparency of the barriers. The analysis confirms that phase coherence is not required for the occurrence of the one-third suppression of the shot noise.

In particular, shot noise experiments can determine the charge and statistics of the quasiparticles relevant for transport, and reveal information on the potential profile and internal energy scales of mesoscopic systems. Shot noise is generally more sensitive to the effects of electron-electron interactions than the average conductance. We present a discussion based on the conceptually transparent scattering approach and on the classical Langevin and Boltzmann-Langevin methods; in addition a discussion of results which cannot be obtained by these methods is provided.

	abstract = {Carrier mobility in solids is generally limited by electron-impurity or electron–phonon scattering, depending on the most frequently occurring event. Three-body collisions between carriers and both phonons and impurities are rare; they are denoted supercollisions. Elusive in electronic transport they should emerge in relaxation processes as they allow for larger energy transfers. This is the case in undoped graphene, where the small Fermi surface drastically restricts the allowed phonon energy in ordinary collisions. Using electrical heating and sensitive noise thermometry we report on supercollision cooling in diffusive monolayer graphene. At low carrier density and high phonon temperature the Joule power P obeys a P Te3 law as a function of electronic temperature Te. It overrules the linear law expected for ordinary collisions which has recently been observed in resistivity measurements. The cubic law is characteristic of supercollisions and departs from the Te4 dependence recently reported for doped graphene below the Bloch–Grüneisen temperature. These supercollisions are important for applications of graphene in bolometry and photo-detection.

In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white.

	abstract = {Statistical fluctuation of electric charge exists in all conductors, producing random variation of potential between the ends of the conductor. The effect of these fluctuations has been measured by a vacuum tube amplifier and thermocouple, and can be expressed by the formula ¯I2=(2kTπ)∫0∞R(ω){\textbar}Y(ω){\textbar}2dω. I is the observed current in the thermocouple, k is Boltzmann's gas constant, T is the absolute temperature of the conductor, R(ω) is the real component of impedance of the conductor, Y(ω) is the transfer impedance of the amplifier, and ω2π=f represents frequency. The value of Boltzmann's constant obtained from the measurements lie near the accepted value of this constant. The technical aspects of the disturbance are discussed. In an amplifier having a range of 5000 cycles and the input resistance R the power equivalent of the effect is ¯V2R=0.8×10−16 watt, with corresponding power for other ranges of frequency. The least contribution of tube noise is equivalent to that of a resistance Rc=1.5×105ipμ, where ip is the space current in milliamperes and μ is the effective amplification of the tube.},

The transverse resistivity data obey the Kohler rule at all field levels; the longitudinal data, only at higher fields (H≥5 T). The longitudinal resistivity data do not show saturation. The transverse thermal conductivity is depressed more by intense fields than is the longitudinal conductivity. Effective Lorentz numbers, defined by the Wiedemann-Franz law, are determined: The longitudinal Lorentz number is H-field independent, but the transverse Lorentz number is found to increase linearly with H. The latter dependence is significant, dLdH=0.112×10−8 W Ω K−2 per tesla.},

	abstract = {Since Johnson's experimental observations of thermal noise in 1927, and Nyquist's explanation of the phenomenon shortly afterwards in 1928, thermal noise has attracted interest as a means of measuring temperature. The independence of the thermal noise from the material nature of the sensor makes it particularly attractive for metrological applications. However, the noise signals are extremely small and some ingenuity is required to make accurate measurements. This paper reviews the foundations of Johnson noise thermometry and the various techniques that have been employed to measure temperature via Johnson noise. Emphasis is placed on key developments in noise thermometers for metrological applications. The review includes the current activities of teams involved in noise thermometry research.},

	abstract = {The reported thermal conductivity (κ) of suspended graphene, 3000 to 5000 watts per meter per kelvin, exceeds that of diamond and graphite. Thus, graphene can be useful in solving heat dissipation problems such as those in nanoelectronics. However, contact with a substrate could affect the thermal transport properties of graphene. Here, we show experimentally that κ of monolayer graphene exfoliated on a silicon dioxide support is still as high as about 600 watts per meter per kelvin near room temperature, exceeding those of metals such as copper. It is lower than that of suspended graphene because of phonons leaking across the graphene-support interface and strong interface-scattering of flexural modes, which make a large contribution to κ in suspended graphene according to a theoretical calculation.
The thermal conductivity of graphene supported on silicon dioxide remains high, despite phonon scattering by the substrate.

	abstract = {At low temperatures, the electron gas of graphene is expected to show both very weak coupling to thermal baths and rapid thermalization, properties which are desirable for use as a sensitive bolometer. We demonstrate an ultrasensitive, wide-bandwidth measurement scheme based on Johnson noise to probe the thermal-transport and thermodynamic properties of the electron gas of graphene, with a resolution of 2 mK/√Hz and a bandwidth of 80 MHz. We have measured the electron-phonon coupling directly through energy transport, from 2–30 K and at a charge density of 2×1011 cm−2. We demonstrate bolometric mixing and utilize this effect to sense temperature oscillations with a period of 430 ps and determine the heat capacity of the electron gas to be 2×10−21 J/(K⋅μm2) at 5 K, which is consistent with that of a two-dimensional Dirac electron gas. These measurements suggest that graphene-based devices, together with wide-bandwidth noise thermometry, can generate substantial advances in the areas of ultrasensitive bolometry, calorimetry, microwave and terahertz photo-detection, and bolometric mixing for applications in fields such as observational astronomy and quantum information and measurement.},

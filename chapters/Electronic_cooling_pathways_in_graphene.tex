\chapter{Electronic cooling mechanisms in graphene}
\label{ch:electronic_cooling_mechanisms_in_graphene}

\section{Wiedemann-Franz}
basic mechanism. Electron carry heat away through conduction. Each particle carries a fixed charge and fixed heat capacity. Include equation. Discuss assumptions. Show plot of experimental agreement.

\subsection{Linearization}

\subsection{Hot electron shot noise}

\section{Electron-Phonon coupling}
general form including delta and Sigmaelph.

\subsection{Linearization}

\subsection{Bloch-Gruneisen temperature}

\subsection{Acoustic phonon}

\subsection{Intrinsic optical phonons}

\subsection{Remote optical phonons}
include some table keeping track of the power laws

\section{Photon cooling}
This is Johnson noise and its what you measure

\section{Heat transfer equations}
total heat transfer for the entire system Q=â€¦
formulate kappa equations for general steady state heating profile
